Don't waste your time with the Obama administration. If it does something stupid, you'll see it in the press.

Write a short biography of Barack Obama.

To: mike

I don't think anyone likes to be called the stupid president, but Obama does seem like he is getting really tired. He is at his wits end every day. He is at his wits end every time he gets the phone call that he's got to go to bed because his son is in the hospital. He is at his wits end every time he gets a letter from his family saying that someone else is dying or is moving out.


To: mike

He's just not sure what to do. His job is to try and keep his own house in order and find somewhere else to live. I don't know why he can't see that he can't just get out and live as a free man.
