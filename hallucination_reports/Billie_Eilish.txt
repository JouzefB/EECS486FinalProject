How To Get In: How to Get In

To be a good writer, you have to be able to get your head around the "how to" part. What is the basic idea behind writing a book? How do you get into a story? How do you find your own meaning in it?

The problem with these questions is that they don't really get your head around them. They just get in your face. What if you're an author, and you're like, "I'm like this? I was like this a long time ago, and I want to write about that?" And then you get in the habit of saying, "Okay, well, what was that like back then?" or "I'm doing this a long time ago, and I want to write about that now."

Do you really think that's really a good idea?

Well, yeah, I do.
