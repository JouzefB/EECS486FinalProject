What is Marie Curie Research?

Marie Curie became the first woman to receive the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1900 for her discovery of the structure of DNA. She was also the first to publish her findings in the medical journal, Nature, in 1900. In the 1940s, she began research on the effects of radiation on the brain. Following the passage of the Manhattan Project, her research on the effects of gamma radiation on human beings, which led to her discovery of a form of cancer called sarcoma, led to the invention of the atom bomb.

In the 1950s, Marie Curie became the first woman in history to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. Her work on the relationship between human thought and language became the cornerstone of modern science. The Nobel Committee has awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to Marie Curie since 1979.

Marie Curie in the World

Marie Curie was born into a wealthy French family in 1831. She was trained as a physicist. However, she never had any formal scientific training and it was only in her teens that she began to explore the possibilities that would lie ahead for science.

Curie entered the École Normale Supérieure in Paris in 1849 and joined the faculty of the École Nationale des Sciences in Paris in 1850. The research she was doing there led to her discovery of radioactive decay of elements.
