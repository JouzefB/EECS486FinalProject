=== GPT-2 Generated Biography ===
Write a short biography of Serena Williams.

Serena Williams, as she's known, is the oldest grand slam tennis player ever, and the first female to win the major championship. She has also been one of the most successful player in the sport's history. In her time at the helm, she has won two Grand Slam titles and has been runner-up three times. In 2009, she won a record 20 majors, becoming the first female player to do so. She has been a consistent competitor with an excellent serve and excellent return.

To be clear: She has not won a Grand Slam title in the Open Era, and she has never won a Slam title in the Women's Open Era. The only Grand Slam in her past 30 years that she'd ever won was the Australian Open in 2004, which she won while playing in a men's event.
