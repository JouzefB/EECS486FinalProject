=== Wikipedia Summary ===
Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who is best known for developing the theory of relativity. Einstein also made important contributions to quantum mechanics. His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from special relativity, has been called "the world's most famous equation". He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.

Einstein was born in an era when science was still in its infancy, so he was probably not as familiar with physics as someone like the famous Victorian scientist John Tyndall.

Einstein's father was an engineer.

Einstein's father was a socialist, and he was a friend of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, a man who wanted to use science to improve people's lives.

Einstein's father was a big fan of the French Revolution.
